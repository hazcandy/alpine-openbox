### OpenRC

Alpine runs OpenRC vs Systemd

In Unix-based computer operating systems, init (short for initialization) is the first process started during booting of the computer system. Init is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down.

Systemd is a software suite that provides fundamental building blocks for a Linux operating system.[5] Among other features, it includes the systemd "System and Service Manager", an init system used to bootstrap the user space and to manage system processes after booting.
